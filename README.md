This template use cmake as build and complie support, conan build external framework (e.g. GTest), Clion integrated them together.

This template design for multiple sub-projects architecture and optimized conan with once build unlimited reuse.

## What is [Cmake](https://cmake.org/)？

Long Description - CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

Short answer - **build and complie tools for C++**

## What is [Conan](https://conan.io/) ? 

The open source, decentralized and multi-platform package manager to create and share all your native binaries. 

**Build third party dependency, such as Google Test**

## What is [Clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/?rss) ?

 A cross-platform IDE for C and C++

Happy Coding : )

## Get Stated a new sub-project

1. create a new directory under `src` 
   ![image-20211003144612449](https://minio.llycloud.com/image/uPic/image-20211003BfDxwF.png)

2. create a test file in the `Test` Folder
   ![image-20211003144712956](https://minio.llycloud.com/image/uPic/image-20211003lutSVc.png)

3. create your sub_cmake
   ![image-20210722014725344](https://minio.llycloud.com/image/uPic/image-202107228LiAsI.png)

4. Add following configuration

   ```cmake
   include_directories(
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/
   ) # including current .h header (do not modify)
   
   conan_basic_setup() # conan support
   
   add_executable(new_project # your sub-project name
           # add your source file (cpp file only)
           ../Test/new_project_test.cpp
           )
   
   target_link_libraries(new_project # must identical to sub-project name
           ${CONAN_LIBS}
           )
   ```

5. In your **ROOT** Level Cmake file add following configuration

   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(src/new_project)
   ```
